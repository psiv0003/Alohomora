This project has been developed using a RaspberryPi, Camera and Motion sensors. The idea behind this is that the device would be placed outside the main door of your house, and whenever someone rings the bell, the user would get notified of it in the application. If it's a person in your contacts, you would then get a customized notification with his details and have the option of letting them in (or closing the door!) This application also detects motion near your door and sends across notifications for the same. And lastly, it also opens the door automatically for you!

Python was used to program the IoT device and used Firebase as the online database. 

The iOS application was developed using Swift5.
